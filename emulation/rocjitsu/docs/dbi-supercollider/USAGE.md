# DBI SuperCollider MVP Usage

This is the current runbook for the SuperCollider-style LDS race MVP in
rocJITsu. The mode is instrumentation-only on the local RDNA4 `gfx1201` device;
it is not meant to translate the code object to another architecture.

## Build

From the `rocm-systems` tree:

```sh
cmake --build emulation/rocjitsu/build --target rocjitsu_dbi_hooks
cmake --build emulation/rocjitsu/build --target rocjitsu_tests
```

The HSA tools library built by the first command is:

```text
emulation/rocjitsu/build/lib/rocjitsu/src/rocjitsu/hooks/librocjitsu_dbi_hooks.so
```

## How The Hook Is Loaded

Use the HSA tools path:

```sh
env \
  HSA_TOOLS_LIB=/home/benoit/workspace/TheRock/rocm-systems/emulation/rocjitsu/build/lib/rocjitsu/src/rocjitsu/hooks/librocjitsu_dbi_hooks.so \
  RJ_DBI_SUPERCOLLIDER=1 \
  RJ_DBI_LOG=1 \
  RJ_DBI_SC_DELAY=2 \
  ./app
```

`HSA_TOOLS_LIB` is the same HSA-level mechanism used by other ROCm tools:

- `projects/rocr-runtime/runtime/hsa-runtime/core/util/flag.h` reads
  `HSA_TOOLS_LIB` in the ROCr runtime.
- `projects/rocprofiler/doc/ROCProfiler_V1_API_spec.md` documents
  `HSA_TOOLS_LIB` as the library loaded by the HSA runtime for rocprofiler.
- `projects/rocr-debug-agent/docs/how-to/user-guide.rst` uses
  `HSA_TOOLS_LIB=/opt/rocm/lib/librocm-debug-agent.so.2 ./my_program`.
- The HSA API surface being wrapped is documented in
  `projects/rocr-runtime/runtime/hsa-runtime/inc/hsa.h` and
  `projects/rocr-runtime/runtime/hsa-runtime/inc/hsa_api_trace.h`; the relevant
  calls are the code-object reader creation APIs and
  `hsa_executable_load_agent_code_object`.

The MVP uses this HSA tools loader path. A separate waitcheck-style
`LD_PRELOAD` path is not needed for the current DBI SuperCollider work.

## Environment Variables

- `RJ_DBI_SUPERCOLLIDER=1`: enable the DBI SuperCollider mode.
- `RJ_DBI_LOG=1`: emit compact info logs. Higher numeric values enable more
  verbose per-kernel diagnostics.
- `RJ_DBI_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/rj-dbi-dump`: write original memory-backed code objects,
  and patched code objects when a patch is produced, as `.hsaco` files for
  `llvm-readelf` / `llvm-objdump` inspection.
- `RJ_DBI_SC_CHECK_TRAP_MODE=all|lds|flat`: restrict the primary check/trap
  instrumentation scope. The default is `all`: try native `ds_*` LDS
  instrumentation first, then try likely group/LDS `flat_*` instrumentation if
  the native DS pass did not patch that code object. Use `lds` or `flat` only
  for targeted debugging.
- `RJ_DBI_SC_DELAY=N`: configure the delay between the original LDS/flat access
  and the duplicate/readback check.
- `RJ_DBI_SC_DELAY_MODE=nop|sleep|sleep_var`: choose the delay encoding. The
  default `nop` mode emits `N` simple `s_nop 0` instructions. The `sleep` mode
  emits one `s_sleep N` instruction when `N > 0`; `N` must fit the 16-bit
  `s_sleep` immediate. The `sleep_var` mode emits one `s_sleep_var` instruction
  when `N > 0`.
- `RJ_DBI_SC_DELAY_VAR_SSRC=N`: scalar source operand encoding for
  `RJ_DBI_SC_DELAY_MODE=sleep_var`. The default is `106`, the RDNA4 `vcc_lo`
  operand encoding already preserved by the injected native-DS compare path.
- `RJ_DBI_SC_MAX_PATCHES=N`: bound how many native-DS or flat/VFLAT check/trap
  sites can be instrumented in a single code object. The default is `1`.
  Selection is file-ordered and rejects overlapping inline ranges, anchor
  rewrites, and local NOP caves.
- `RJ_DBI_SC_TMP_VGPR=N`: force a scratch VGPR. Use this for hand-shaped tests
  whose kernel descriptor reserves the selected VGPR.
- `RJ_DBI_SC_REQUIRE_PATCH=1`: test guard. If a code object has a supported MVP
  site in the active check/trap scope but no patch is emitted, fail the load.
  Code objects with no supported sites still pass through.
- `RJ_DBI_SC_FAULT_DROP_BARRIER=1`: demo-only synchronization fault injection.
  After the primary proof/instrumentation pass, rewrite one decoded
  `s_barrier*` instruction to `s_nop 0`.
- `RJ_DBI_SC_FAULT_BARRIER_INDEX=N`: select which decoded barrier to drop in a
  code object. The default is `0`.
- `RJ_DBI_FAIL_CLOSED=1`: debugging guard that rejects unsupported kernels
  rather than quietly skipping them.

The default check/trap scope is combined but conservative. For a given code
object, rocJITsu tries native DS first and falls back to flat/VFLAT only if the
native DS pass did not already modify that object. Same-code-object composition
of native DS and flat/VFLAT rewriting is still future work because it needs a
shared patch-range reservation plan and patching from already-modified bytes.
Barrier fault injection is composable because it runs after the selected
check/trap path. The bring-up-only probes below are explicit debug overrides of
the default check/trap path.

Additional bring-up-only probes also exist:

- `RJ_DBI_SC_PROBE_NOP=1`
- `RJ_DBI_SC_PROBE_TRAMPOLINE_NOP=1`
- `RJ_DBI_SC_PROBE_ENDPGM=1`
- `RJ_DBI_SC_PROBE_LDS_ENDPGM=1`
- `RJ_DBI_SC_PROBE_FLAT_TRAP=1`

Those are useful for debugging code-object mutation but are not the race-check
mode. `RJ_DBI_SC_PROBE_TRAMPOLINE_NOP=1` skips ROCclr runtime helper-only code
objects and code objects with no supported DBI candidate sites.
`RJ_DBI_SC_PROBE_FLAT_TRAP=1` rewrites likely group/LDS `flat_load/store` sites
in place as `s_trap 0; s_nop 0; s_nop 0`; it is intentionally destructive and
should make an executing patched site fail.

## Coverage Signal

With `RJ_DBI_LOG=1`, look for:

```text
SuperCollider DBI summary reader=... kernels=... candidates=... skips=... rejects=... supported_lds_sites=... flat_sites=... patches=... modified=...
```

Interpretation:

- `modified=true` and `patches>0`: this code object was actually patched.
- `inline-barrier-nop-rewrite`: demo-only sync-fault injection rewrote one
  selected decoded barrier to `s_nop 0`. It intentionally skips ROCclr
  runtime-helper-only code objects.
- `supported_lds_sites=0`: the current native-DS MVP found no supported
  instructions in this code object.
- `local-cave-lds-load-check-trap` / `local-cave-lds-store-check-trap` patch
  logs mean a compact native DS site was redirected through uncovered local NOP
  slack and returned to the original fallthrough. The focused IREE WMMA
  ROCm/HIP e2e object now patches one `ds_load_2addr_b64` site this way and
  passes under `RJ_DBI_SC_REQUIRE_PATCH=1`.
- `flat_sites>0`: flat/generic memory sites were decoded and logged at
  `RJ_DBI_LOG=2`.
- `function_flat_maybe_group_hints>0`: helper-function flat sites are likely
  LDS/shared accesses. The destructive flat proof can patch these with
  `RJ_DBI_SC_PROBE_FLAT_TRAP=1`. Padded likely group flat loads and stores are
  checked by the default fallback when native DS did not patch the code object;
  ordinary unpadded hip-moi helper sites can be checked through conservative
  local NOP caves when they are reachable.
- `local-cave-flat-load-check-trap` / `local-cave-flat-store-check-trap` patch
  logs mean an unpadded flat helper site was redirected through uncovered local
  NOP slack and returned to the original fallthrough. The focused hip-moi
  `NoPipelineProd16x8` object now patches one such site and passes cleanly.
- `skips>0` with `modified=false`: the hook observed the code object but chose
  pass-through for policy or coverage reasons.
- `rejects>0`: the hook found something it considered unsafe or unsupported.
- Proof-mode warnings such as `skipped ROCclr runtime helper code object` and
  `skipped code object without supported DBI candidate sites` mean the proof
  mode intentionally avoided an expensive or unsafe trampoline search.
- For flat/VFLAT fallback, an unpadded skip warning includes
  `supported_candidates=...`, `scratchable_candidates=...`,
  `max_observed_padding_words=...`, `append_cave_reachable_candidates=...`,
  `uncovered_nop_caves=...`, `max_uncovered_nop_cave_words=...`, and
  `local_cave_reachable_candidates=...` so the local-cave/code-growth gap is
  measurable. In the focused hip-moi `NoPipelineProd16x8` object, appended
  end-of-text caves are not directly reachable, but conservative uncovered NOP
  caves are reachable for all 31 likely group flat helper candidates observed so
  far.

The broad hip-moi matmul kernels observed so far use flat/generic and scratch
forms rather than native `ds_load/store_*`. The focused IREE e2e kernels do
expose compact native DS sites. The current hook can identify and destructively
trap likely group/LDS flat helper-function sites. The non-destructive
race-checking paths currently cover padded native DS sites, compact native DS
sites when local caves are reachable, padded likely group flat sites, and
unpadded likely group flat sites when conservative local NOP caves are reachable.

## What The MVP Instruments

The current live-safe path instruments native non-atomic LDS instructions with
enough trailing `s_nop 0` padding to fit an in-place sequence:

- `ds_load_b32`
- `ds_load_b64`
- `ds_load_b128`
- `ds_load_2addr_b32`
- `ds_load_2addr_b64`
- `ds_load_2addr_stride64_b32`
- `ds_load_2addr_stride64_b64`
- `ds_store_b32`
- `ds_store_b64`
- `ds_store_b128`
- likely group/LDS `flat_load_b32`
- likely group/LDS `flat_load_b64`
- likely group/LDS `flat_load_b128`
- likely group/LDS `flat_store_b32`
- likely group/LDS `flat_store_b64`
- likely group/LDS `flat_store_b128`

For loads, the patch duplicates the load after the requested NOP delay and traps
if the two values differ. For stores, the patch reads back the stored LDS value
after the requested NOP delay and traps if it differs from the original stored
value. The injected compares preserve `vcc_lo` by saving it to a
liveness-selected SGPR. For native DS and likely group flat helper sites, the
patch may either use trailing padding or redirect through conservative uncovered
local NOP caves, bounded by `RJ_DBI_SC_MAX_PATCHES`.

## Limitations

- Flat/generic LDS provenance is conservative. The hook can identify likely
  group/LDS helper-function flat sites and destructively trap them. The
  non-destructive check/trap path can patch eligible sites through padding or
  local NOP caves, bounded by `RJ_DBI_SC_MAX_PATCHES`, but it still does not
  prove that every decoded flat access is an LDS access.
- No shadow memory and no non-trapping report buffer yet; `s_trap` is the MVP
  signal.
- Same-value races and unlucky schedules can be missed.
- Appended trampoline/code-growth patching remains bring-up-only. Proof NOP
  mode is gated to candidate-bearing non-ROCclr code objects; use the padded or
  local-cave check/trap paths for MVP race checks.
- Scratch selection is liveness-based and fail-closed. The patcher does not grow
  the kernel's VGPR allocation metadata or spill arbitrary live registers, so a
  site with no free scratch VGPR/SGPR run is skipped.
- Atomic, fence-heavy, global-memory, async-copy, and barrier-epoch cases are
  unsupported and should be skipped or rejected with diagnostics.
